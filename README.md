# emoji-extractor
Extract a list of emojis from emojipedia.com and generate a config file for the emoji-mart component

I needed a list of emojis android 5.0 compatible emojis that I could use with [emoji-mart](https://github.com/missive/emoji-mart)

I wasn't able to find a suitable data file containing these emojis, so I used the lists available on [emojipedia](https://emojipedia.org)

The script isn't perfect, but it will give you a head start.

### Running the project

`npm install`

`npm start`
